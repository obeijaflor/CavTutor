=====

1. As a user, I can create a listing on the website showing what classes I am
   available to tutor.

2. As an internal developer for CavTutor, I should be able to create a new µ-service
   to parse a list of courses for a given university (in `.csv` format) and use our API
   to update any courses that already exist and create new records.
      
3. As an internal developer, I can create new objects by simply sending a `POST`
   request to our API µ-service. The API should also provide distinct feedback
   indicating when an object already exists in our system, so the program
   will know to send an update request instead.

4. As a user looking for tutors, I can post a listing on our website looking for
   tutors in my area.

5. As a user, I should be able to both be a tutor and a tutee for 
   different subjects in the CavTutor system.

6. As a tutor, I should be able to view a complete list of all the people I tutor
   in each course.

7. As an independent tutor not tied to a university, I should be able to list myself as a tutor
   without having to associate myself with a particular course or institution.

8. As a user, I should be able to tutor for one institution and be a tutee at another.

9. As a tutor, I can post my hourly rate to the public.

   receiving help with a course.
