1. John is a tutor at Minnesota State University  Moorhead. He isn't new to
   tutoring, but he only likes to tutor CSIS 152 (Introduction to Computers and
   Programming I) students. He charges a flat rate of $15.00/hr, but finds it
   hard to find new clients at his University by just putting up fliers. He
   wants to create a listing on our website showing what classes he is willing
   to tutor and his hourly rate.

2. Jane is a internal developer for CavTutor. She wants to create a new µ-service
   to parse a list of courses for a given university (in .csv format) and use our API
   to update any courses that already exist and create new records otherwise.
   Our application should allow her to create new objects by simply sending a `POST`
   request to our API µ-service. The API should also provide distinct feedback
   indicating when an object already exists in our system, so Jane's program
   will know to send an update request instead.

3. Ren is a History major who is having trouble understanding the material her
   professor covers in class--she talks very quickly, and has hard-to-read
   slides jam-packed full of information. They are looking for someone to help
   her make sense of her notes, and summarize what she needs to know for the
   upcoming midterm exam. They post a listing on our website looking for
   history tutors in their area.
