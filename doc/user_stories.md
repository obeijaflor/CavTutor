1. John is a tutor at Minnesota State University  Moorhead. He isn't new to
   tutoring, but he only likes to tutor CSIS 152 (Introduction to Computers and
   Programming I) students. He charges a flat rate of $15.00/hr, but finds it
   hard to find new clients at his University by just putting up fliers. He
   wants to create a listing on our website showing what classes he is willing
   to tutor and his hourly rate.

2. Jane is a internal developer for CavTutor. She wants to create a new µ-service
   to parse a list of courses for a given university (in .csv format) and use our API
   to update any courses that already exist and create new records otherwise.
   Our application should allow her to create new objects by simply sending a `POST`
   request to our API µ-service. The API should also provide distinct feedback
   indicating when an object already exists in our system, so Jane's program
   will know to send an update request instead.

3. Ren is a History major who is having trouble understanding the material her
   professor covers in class--she talks very quickly, and has hard-to-read
   slides jam-packed full of information. They are looking for someone to help
   her make sense of her notes, and summarize what she needs to know for the
   upcoming midterm exam. They post a listing on our website looking for
   history tutors in their area.

4. Herman is a 1st-year Computer Science student in the College of Arts & Sciences,
   and is ahead for his year. He is extremely savvy in Python, and wants to tutor
   CS 1110. However, he is not a strong writer, and is struggling in his ENWR
   First Year writing course. Herman should be able to both be a tutor and a
   tutee in the CavTutor system.

5. Sarah is well versed in history, math, and science. She tutors people
   in different courses at several different area institutions. With such a variety
   of clientele, she finds it hard to keep organized and be prepared. Sarah should
   be able to view a complete list of all the people she tutors.

6. Andrew is a retired high school physics teacher who is looking to start
   tutoring as a side hobby. Andrew should be able to list himself as a tutor
   without having to associate himself with a particular course or institution,
   since he is not a student or school faculty member.

7. Melissa is a recent transfer student to Colorado University–Boulder from a
   local community college. She's a computer science major, but is struggling
   in her core math requirements. Melissa is interested in tutoring computer
   science at her old community  college, but also needs to get help with her
   math classes at her current institution. She should be able to be both a
   tutor for one institution yet a tutee at another in the CavTutor system.
